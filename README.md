# Technical Challenge Setup

This repository is used to preparing new MetaMask Shared Libraries team technical challenges.

The repository setup is automated with the "Setup a new technical challenge repository" GitHub Action. You can run this action by following these steps:

* Navigating to the "Actions" tab of this repository
* Select the "Setup a new technical challenge repository" workflow in the left sidebar
* Select the "Run workflow" dropdown on the right side of the screen
* Enter the candidate's _exact_ GitHub username in the GitHub username field 
* Click "Run workflow"

This will create the repository and invite the candidate as a collaborator. They should get an email from GitHub at this point, but we can send the repository link to them directly as well in case they miss the email.
